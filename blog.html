         <div><b>ABSTRACT:</b></div><br>
			Agentic AI represents a burgeoning paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond traditional reactive systems towards autonomous agents capable of not just executing tasks but also reasoning, adapting, and pursuing complex goals within a dynamic and potentially uncertain environment. This research explores the theoretical foundations, technical challenges, and ethical implications of this emerging field, specifically focusing on the development of AI systems with genuine agency – the capacity to act independently with intent and self-awareness, albeit within defined constraints. Traditional AI often relies on explicit programming, hindering the potential for adaptability and genuine problem-solving. Agentic AI seeks to overcome this limitation by incorporating elements of autonomous cognitive architectures and incorporating a robust ethical framework.
				<br><br>
			<b>Background and Motivation:</b> The rapid advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing have fueled the demand for intelligent systems. However, existing approaches frequently lack the foundational understanding and inherent self-control required for truly autonomous decision-making. The inherent risks associated with complex, unsupervised learning algorithms, particularly in scenarios with unpredictable human interaction, necessitate a paradigm change. Agentic AI aims to address these concerns by framing AI development as the creation of agents that can iteratively refine their goals and strategies based on experience, while simultaneously considering and mitigating potential negative consequences.
				<br><br>
		<b>Core Concepts & Architectural Framework:</b> Agentic AI departs from traditional agent design by integrating several key concepts:	
         <br><br>
         <div>Key Points & Concepts: </div>
         <ul>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Goal-Oriented Behavior Planning (GOBP):</b> Agents will employ a robust GOBP system, enabling them to define complex goals and decompose them into manageable sub-tasks, utilizing heuristic exploration and reinforcement learning to find optimal strategies.</li>
			<br></br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Self-Awareness & Intentionality:</b> Rather than simply executing instructions, agents will be designed to possess a rudimentary form of “intentionality,” understanding their own capabilities and limitations. This is a crucial element for ethical considerations.</li>
			<br></br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Explainability & Transparency:</b> A significant focus will be placed on developing explainable AI (XAI) techniques that allow us to trace the agent’s decision-making process, facilitating debugging, auditing, and building trust.</li>
			<br></br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Epistemic Reasoning & Meta-Learning:</b> Agents will integrate mechanisms for knowledge acquisition (through experience) and reasoning, allowing them to adapt their goals and strategies as new information becomes available. Meta-learning will be used to train agents on a variety of problems, increasing their ability to generalize across different domains.</li>
			<br></br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Ethical Framework Embedded:</b> We propose a layered ethical framework – a combination of rule-based constraints, utility-based evaluation, and a form of “moral compass” – that guides the agent's behavior and prevents it from pursuing potentially harmful objectives. This framework will be adaptable to specific contexts and can be refined through observation and feedback.</li>
			<b><br>
			<div><b>Challenges and Future Directions:</b>Several key challenges remain, including:</div>
			<br><br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Formalizing Ethics:</b> Developing formal and verifiable ethical principles that can be embedded into agent behavior is a complex undertaking, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration between philosophy, computer science, and law.</li>
			<br><br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Scalability & Robustness:</b> Ensuring agent scalability (handling increasingly complex tasks) and robustness (resistance to adversarial attacks or unexpected situations) is paramount.</li>
			<br><br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Verification & Validation:</b> Establishing rigorous methods for verifying and validating agent behavior, particularly in critical applications.</li>
			<br><br>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Long-Term Alignment:</b> Addressing the “alignment problem” – ensuring that AI goals remain aligned with human values throughout their lifespan – presents a significant challenge.</li>
			<br><br>
			<div><b>Conclusion:</b> Agentic AI represents a critical step towards creating truly autonomous and responsible AI systems. While significant technical hurdles remain, the potential benefits – from solving complex societal problems to unlocking new levels of human-AI collaboration – justify continued investment in this transformative research area.</div>

         <div><b>ABSTRACT:</b></div><br>
          A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastrucutre and workflows. Zero trusts assumes there is not implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e. - local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). 
				<br><br>
				Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.).
				<br><br>
				An enterprise may choose to implement a ZTA based on placing individual or groups of resources on a unique network segment protected by a gateway security component. In this approach, the enterprise places infrastructure devices such as intelligent switches, routers, next generation firewalls (NGFWs) or special purpose gateway devices to act as PEPs protecting each resource or small group of related resources. Alternatively (or additionally), the enterprise may choose to implement host-based micro-segmentation using software agents or firewalls on the endpoint asset(s). These gateway devices dynamically grant access to individuals requests from a client, asset or service. Depending on the model, the gateway may be the sole PEP component or part of a multipart PEP consisting of the gateway and client-side agent.

			<li style="list-style-type: circle;">All data sources and computing services are considered resources.</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: circle;">All communication is secured regardless of network location.</li>

         <div><b>ABSTRACT:</b></div><br>
          The requirements for the actual usage of artificial intelligence hinge on increased constraints as the needs grow increasingly ambitious and the surge in electricity use prove costly. Based on current research, this  translates into about a 30% increase (over time) for electricity use alone and in the coming years is projected to increase.
				<br><br>
				A simple query ingested into an AI model now requires ten times as much electricity as a normal Google Search.
				<br><br>
				This raises a huge concern for sustainability as fossil fuels run at a substantial cost. The alternative, among other renewable clean energy sources, is nuclear. 
				<br><br>
				With big business forging full steam ahead, the byproducts of such radical change are current hits to employment that resulnut in massive layoffs.With these underlying drivers operating at the detriment of tech employees, those who've self-invested with the hope of achieving job security turn to upskilling in order to stayahead of the pack. Others pivot by pursuing certifications offered by NVIDIA, IBM, DataCamp, and Harvard Extension School. In the current marketplace almost solely driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning models, an intersting dynamic is upscaling the frontier of our digitial world and what awaits in this new and uncharted territory requires regulation that we just might have the language to describe. Deep learning seeds these models from the most granular through to the higher-level abstractions on the subject. But what exactly is deep learning? The following notes from a recently observed crash course on the subject left me with key takeaways that help build a general framework to describe what deep learning is at its root.
